## Business Problem
An Auto Insurance company in the USA is facing issues in retaining its customers and wants to advertise promotional offers for its loyal customers. They are considering Customer Lifetime Value CLV as a parameter for this purpose. <br>
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) signifies the worth of a customer to a company across a specified duration.  In the insurance sector, where competition is intense, customers consider more than just insurance premiums when making decisions.  Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), being centered on the customer, offers a strong foundation for retaining high-value clients, earning more from lower-valued clients, and improving overall customer satisfaction. Effectively leveraging CLV can result in better customer acquisition and retention, decreased churn rates, informed marketing budget planning, detailed ad performance measurement, and numerous other advantages.
